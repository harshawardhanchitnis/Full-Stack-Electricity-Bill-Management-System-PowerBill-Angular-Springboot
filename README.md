# Electricity Bill Management System (PowerBill)

## PROJECT â€“ ELECTRICITY BILL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (POWERBILL)

## Project Overview
The **Electricity Bill Management System (PowerBill)** is a **Full-stack web application** designed to simplify and digitize the management of electricity bills for both customers and administrators.  
The backend is built using **Spring Boot** with a **microservices architecture**, separating the `Customer Service` and `Admin Service` components, which communicate through a **Eureka Server** for service discovery. Data is stored in an **H2 in-memory database** for lightweight persistence, and **Swagger UI** is integrated for API documentation and testing.  

The frontend, developed using **Angular 15** and styled with **SCSS**, delivers a **responsive, user-friendly interface** for bill tracking, payment processing, and administrative control. The application is divided into **Customer** and **Admin** modules, each tailored for their respective roles.  

---

## Motivation
Traditional electricity billing systems often rely on manual processes or outdated interfaces, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and inconvenient for both service providers and customers. **PowerBill** was developed to:  

- Provide customers with **real-time access** to their billing information and payment options.  
- Equip administrators with a **centralized platform** to manage customers, bills, and payments efficiently.  
- Modernize bill management through **secure, scalable, and easy-to-use** web technologies.

## Steps Undertaken

### 1. Backend Development (Spring Boot Microservices)
**Architecture:**
- **Customer Service** â†’ Handles customer registration, authentication, bill retrieval, payments, and profile management.  
- **Admin Service** â†’ Manages customer records, bill generation, payment status updates, and complaint handling.  
- **Eureka Server** â†’ Provides service discovery for seamless communication between microservices.  

**Implementation Steps:**
- Created entity classes (`Customer`, `Bill`) with proper relationships.  
- Implemented **CRUD operations** for customers and bills using **Spring Data JPA**.  
- Configured **H2 database** for persistent data storage.  
- Exposed secure **RESTful APIs** for both modules.  
- Integrated **Swagger UI** for API documentation and testing.

### 2. Frontend Development (Angular 15 + SCSS)
**Modules:**
- **Customer Module:**
  - Secure registration and login.  
  - View, download, and pay bills (individually or in bulk).  
  - Manage profile information.  
  - Track payment history in real-time.  

- **Admin Module:**
  - Manage customer accounts.  
  - Generate new bills and update payment statuses.  
  - Handle complaints and queries.  
  - Perform CRUD operations on customers and bills.  
  - Monitor system activities.  

**Key Angular Features Implemented:**
- Component-driven architecture for scalability and maintainability.  
- Angular directives (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `ngModel`, `ngSubmit`) for dynamic rendering and data binding.  
- Form validation to prevent invalid or incomplete submissions.  
- HttpClient integration for real-time API communication.  
- Bootstrap for responsiveness and **Font Awesome** for intuitive icons.  

---

### 3. Integration
- Established **frontend-backend communication** using REST APIs.  
- Implemented **cross-module authentication and authorization**.  
- Ensured **real-time synchronization** between customer and admin operations.  

---

## Key Insights
- Microservices architecture enhances **scalability** and **modularity** for future upgrades.  
- Using **H2 database** during development speeds up testing and deployment cycles.  
- **Swagger UI** proved invaluable for testing and verifying API endpoints.  
- Angularâ€™s **two-way data binding** and modular components reduced development time and improved UI/UX.  

---

## Challenges and Lessons Learned
- **Service Coordination:** Proper configuration of Eureka Server and microservice endpoints was crucial for stability.  
- **Form Validation:** Required careful handling to ensure smooth user experience without blocking valid entries.  
- **UI Responsiveness:** Adjustments were needed to make the SCSS designs adaptable across devices.  

---

## Future Work
- Integrate a **real payment gateway** for live transactions.  
- Add **analytics dashboards** for admins to monitor revenue and usage trends.  
- Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** for finer-grained permissions.  
- Deploy to a cloud platform with a production-grade database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL).  

---

## Conclusion
The **Electricity Bill Management System (PowerBill)** successfully combines a **robust Spring Boot backend** with a **modern Angular frontend** to deliver an efficient, scalable, and user-friendly platform for bill management. The project demonstrates expertise in full-stack development, microservices architecture, API integration, and responsive UI design.
